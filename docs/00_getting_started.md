# Getting Started

This is a step-by-step guide for setting up your dev environment and testing LilOS on Windows (and Linux).

## Emmulator Setup
- install [XMing Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) so as to run the Bosch emulator on WSL
- For XMing to connect with Bosch emulator, you need to export this environment (you can add it in your .`~/zshrc` or `~/.profile` file):
    ```
    export DISPLAY=:0
    ```

## Dev Setup
- Set up your Dev Environment, see docs here

## Build and Run
- From the root of the folder, run: `make run`
- The emulator starts in debug mode, so hits the first break-point. Type `c` to continue execution.


## Next Docs

The next docs explain the process taken to write this OS.
